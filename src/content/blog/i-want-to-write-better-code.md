# I want to write better code

## Forward

This is about a new site I have created at [better-code.org](https://better-code.org). I want to preface this post with
that information to remove my bias. And, I want to actually post about why I created it and what I hope to achieve.

## Origin

My want to write better code is the same as a cook wants to create better recipes. It is a human trait to look at what
we have done and think that we can improve that thing. And like all traits, some have it more than others. I have
a strong desire to improve my code and have since I began my career. It is with that curiosity that I have always
tried to learn from my colleagues. Asking how they would solve this problem or how they would write a code snippet.
Trying to root out why they make the choices they do.

I have learned a lot, and I also have an incredible urge to share that with others. So begins the journey of 
Better Code.
